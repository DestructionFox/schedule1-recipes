## Usage

Each product has a base price B:
- Weed: $35
- Meth: $70
- Cocaine: $150

Each effect has a multiplier (as seen above)

After the mix logic is complete and the final effects are known, the multipliers associated with each are summed and the final price is:

**Price = Round( B * ( 1 + Sum[ multipliers ] ) )**

*It might be Floor instead of Round, I’m not sure.*

---

### Example

Start with **Meth** ($70 base)

**Mix:** Gasoline → Cuke → Mouthwash → Banana

**Final effects:** { Euphoric, Thought-Provoking, Balding, Gingeritis }

**Multipliers:** { 0.18, 0.44, 0.30, 0.20 }

**Price = 70 * (1 + (0.18 + 0.44 + 0.30 + 0.20)) = 148.40 → $148**
