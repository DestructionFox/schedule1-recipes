# 🧠 Codex Migration & Integration Plan – Schedule 1

This document outlines the plan for integrating OpenAI Codex functionality into the Schedule 1 Recipe Viewer Project. The goal is to enable smart, context-aware coding assistance for data logic, script generation, and modular AI interactions—streamlining backend JSON and UI logic evolution.

---

## 📦 Purpose of Codex Integration

- ✨ Enhance intelligent automation for JSON validation, UID generation, and smart patching
- 🤖 Enable advanced user commands such as dynamic recipe simulations, effect matching, or stat-based fusion logic
- 🛠️ Replace or supplement procedural scripting in JS/Node with Codex API-injected smart modules
- 📚 Allow Codex to “explain” or auto-generate snippets during in-editor use (via VS Code or web IDE)

---

## 🧩 Target Areas for Codex Use

### ✅ Core Logic (📘 B1)
- Dynamic name generation (`uid_enhanced_recipe_registry`)
- Smart recipe validation
- Auto-complete of missing fields based on schema + context

### ✅ Effect Tools (📘 B2)
- Fusion tree simulation
- Tooltip/effect rarity annotation logic
- Token-based dynamic explanations

### ✅ UI Scripting (📄 C1)
- Recipe card rendering helpers
- Dynamic toggle generators (batch toggle, sorters, filters)
- Fast prototyping of interaction logic

### ✅ Test Labs (📄 B4 / 🧪 D1)
- Simulated path testing (e.g., ingredient mix testing)
- Randomized test generation (e.g., fake effect trees)
- Autopatch or merge test-mode recipes

## 🧠 Implementation Flow

1. **Create isolated Codex endpoint or chat**
   - Use custom system prompt with rules, training lexicon, sample files

2. **Sync with core logic modules**
   - Reads current JSON, Markdown guides, and schema

3. **Allow invocation from Master Vision or module chats**
   - Master Chat (A1) delegates code tasks to Codex via prompt routing

---

## 🔐 Safeguards & Scope

- Codex is NOT used for production code overwrites without validation
- All output must be passed through review stage in test-env or B4
- Prompt logs are retained for auditing/debug

---

## 🛠️ Dependencies

- Access to OpenAI Codex (GPT-4-Turbo w/ code interpreter)
- Optional: Integration with Node.js backend or local script runners
