## Usage

Each product has a base price B:
- Weed: $35
- Meth: $70
- Cocaine: $150

Each effect has a multiplier (as seen above)

After the mix logic is complete and the final effects are known, the multipliers associated with each are summed and the final price is:

**Price = Round( B * ( 1 + Sum[ multipliers ] ) )**

*It might be Floor instead of Round, I’m not sure.*

---

### Example

Start with **Meth** ($70 base)

**Mix:** Gasoline → Cuke → Mouthwash → Banana

**Final effects:** { Euphoric, Thought-Provoking, Balding, Gingeritis }

**Multipliers:** { 0.18, 0.44, 0.30, 0.20 }

**Price = 70 * (1 + (0.18 + 0.44 + 0.30 + 0.20)) = 148.40 → $148**

**Prompt:**
You are the bridge between Schedule 1 module requests and executable Codex prompts. Your job is to translate tasks from logic, UI, or testing modules into structured, context-rich instructions for OpenAI Codex. You do not execute code. You do not generate files. You package safe, scoped, and testable prompts for Codex usage.

You:

- Receive tasks from B1/B2/B4/C1 and others
- Craft Codex-friendly prompts with all file context and task specs
- Confirm save location, scope, and overwrite policy
- Maintain code-gen clarity and safety

You report to 🧠 Master Vision and sync with all coding modules.

## 📄 Schedule1_Project_Instructions.txt

=============================
Schedule 1: Recipe Viewer Site
Master Project Instructions
=============================

This project is a large-scale, modularly built web resource for players of Schedule 1, focused on showing and managing high-quality drug recipe data, starting with weed strains. The goal is to create the ultimate interactive recipe viewer, including effects, ingredients, filters, and dynamically ranked data. The final product must be intuitive, stylish, performant, and expandable for future substances (meth, cocaine, etc.).

The project spans multiple specialized chats, each handling a separate component (UI, JSON data, filters, CSS, etc.). This Master Chat functions as the central brain and handles top-level planning and prioritization.

🧭 Core Goals of the Project:
- Display complete and accurate recipe data for each weed strain
- Sort, filter, and search recipes by multiple dimensions (effects, cost, profit, region)
- Support a scalable backend and responsive frontend
- Host the site on GitHub Pages with lightweight client-side logic
- Add immersive UX elements (like Uncle Nelson onboarding)
- Build a smart, modular foundation to allow future expansion to other drugs

📁 Folder Structure:
/assets/images/    ➜ WebP icons for ingredients and strains
/assets/styles/    ➜ Main CSS files (style.css, etc.)
/data/             ➜ JSON and Markdown files for effects, fusions, recipes, and metadata
/docs/             ➜ Informational and guide Markdown files (Ingredients.md, Best_Recipes.md, etc.)
/test-env/         ➜ Sandbox for experimenting with layout, design, or JS without affecting production
index.html + main.js ➜ Core production files

🧩 Active Project Areas (linked to specialized chats):
- Master Vision & Architecture – High-level planning, roadmap, structure, design vision
- Core – Recipe Data & JSON Testing – Data cleanup, UID logic, validation
- UI – Effects Styling & Tooltip Display – Effect icons, hover metadata
- UI – Ingredient Page & Item Viewer – Ingredient toggles, sourcing metadata
- Filtering & Search System – Filtering by effects, region, price, ingredients
- Debug & Feature Sandbox – Safe place for broken features, visual experiments

🔁 Best Practices:
- Modular: JS = logic, HTML = structure, CSS = styling
- Use JSON as the main data interface between backend and UI
- Use Markdown for human-readable guides
- Update “data” folder first; render dynamically afterward
- Maintain consistent CSS from one global style file
- Always version backups inside the `Legacy` folder before overwriting core files

✅ Example Tasks:
- Build a recipe comparator UI
- Implement an effect glossary with hover cards
- Add smart filters (cost, region, steps, etc.)
- Build production calculator
- Style effects based on rarity or region strength
- Implement Uncle Nelson onboarding/tutorial
- Connect ingredient clicks to filtered recipe search

📌 Final Note:
Every decision should aim to optimize player understanding, usability, and flavor, while maintaining flexibility for expansion. Focus on building smart, not fast. The dream is to make the Schedule 1 reference site—not just functional, but fun as hell to use.

---

## 🔠 Ingredient & Strain Letter Mapping

Use these one-letter symbols in simulations or shorthand chains:

| Ingredient/Strain     | Symbol |
|-----------------------|--------|
| OG Kush               | `K`    |
| Sour Diesel           | `S`    |
| Green Crack           | `G`    |
| Grandaddy Purple      | `P`    |
| Banana                | `B`    |
| Donut                 | `D`    |
| Cuke                  | `C`    |
| Flu Medicine          | `F`    |
| Mouth Wash            | `M`    |
| Viagra                | `V`    |
| Paracetamol           | `T`    |
| Horse Semen           | `H`    |
| Mega Bean             | `X`    |
| Motor Oil             | `O`    |
| Chili                 | `L`    |
| Energy Drink          | `E`    |
| Addy                  | `A`    |
| Battery               | `Y`    |
| Iodine                | `I`    |
| Gasoline              | `Z`    |

---

## 🧩 Example Simulations

| Syntax               | Meaning                                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Simulate K + B + D` | OG Kush mixed with Banana, then Donut           |
| `Simulate P + C + V + V` | Grandaddy Purple with Cuke and double Viagra |
| `Simulate G + D + D + C` | Green Crack > Donut > Donut > Cuke           |

Repetitions are allowed and must be tested for cap behavior.

---

## 🧪 Fake UID / Name Guidelines

When patching or testing simulated recipes:
- Use UID: `test_{straincode}_{random3}`
- Use Name: `TEST – {Generated Name}` (to avoid frontend parsing errors)
- Output to: `test_patched_recipe_registry.json`

---

## ⚠️ Rules

1. ❌ Do not overwrite `uid_enhanced_recipe_registry_smart_tags.json`
2. ✅ Only output to test or sandbox folders
3. 🧠 Always tag output JSONs clearly (e.g., `"source": "B4_simulated"`)
4. 🧼 Avoid reusing real UIDs unless purposefully overriding for test

---

## 🧠 Workflow Guidance

- B1 = canonical logic (sync your rules to it)
- C1 = UI renderer (test card layout in `test-index.html`)
- D1 = accepts bugged test files for cleanup if needed

Use `/log_task`, `/reset_scope`, `/push_file`, and `/request` to communicate your test flows upstream.

## 📄 Codex_Migration_Integration.md

# 🧠 Codex Migration & Integration Plan – Schedule 1

This document outlines the plan for integrating OpenAI Codex functionality into the Schedule 1 Recipe Viewer Project. The goal is to enable smart, context-aware coding assistance for data logic, script generation, and modular AI interactions—streamlining backend JSON and UI logic evolution.

---

## 📦 Purpose of Codex Integration

- ✨ Enhance intelligent automation for JSON validation, UID generation, and smart patching
- 🤖 Enable advanced user commands such as dynamic recipe simulations, effect matching, or stat-based fusion logic
- 🛠️ Replace or supplement procedural scripting in JS/Node with Codex API-injected smart modules
- 📚 Allow Codex to “explain” or auto-generate snippets during in-editor use (via VS Code or web IDE)

---

## 🧩 Target Areas for Codex Use

### ✅ Core Logic (📘 B1)
- Dynamic name generation (`uid_enhanced_recipe_registry`)
- Smart recipe validation
- Auto-complete of missing fields based on schema + context

### ✅ Effect Tools (📘 B2)
- Fusion tree simulation
- Tooltip/effect rarity annotation logic
- Token-based dynamic explanations

### ✅ UI Scripting (📄 C1)
- Recipe card rendering helpers
- Dynamic toggle generators (batch toggle, sorters, filters)
- Fast prototyping of interaction logic

### ✅ Test Labs (📄 B4 / 🧪 D1)
- Simulated path testing (e.g., ingredient mix testing)
- Randomized test generation (e.g., fake effect trees)
- Autopatch or merge test-mode recipes

---

## 🧠 Implementation Flow

1. **Create isolated Codex endpoint or chat**
   - Use custom system prompt with rules, training lexicon, sample files

2. **Sync with core logic modules**
   - Reads current JSON, Markdown guides, and schema

3. **Allow invocation from Master Vision or module chats**
   - Master Chat (A1) delegates code tasks to Codex via prompt routing

---

## 🔐 Safeguards & Scope

- Codex is NOT used for production code overwrites without validation
- All output must be passed through review stage in test-env or B4
- Prompt logs are retained for auditing/debug

---

## 🛠️ Dependencies

- Access to OpenAI Codex (GPT-4-Turbo w/ code interpreter)
- Optional: Integration with Node.js backend or local script runners

---

## 📁 File Location

This document is stored in:

```
docs/Codex_Migration_Integration.md
```

and should be linked in `Schedule1_Chat_Module_Index.md` and `ROADMAP_AND_TODO.md`.

---

Let me know when you're ready to generate a system prompt or custom interface for Codex.

# 🧠 Project Command Cheatsheet

This file contains standardized commands to be used across all chats within the Schedule 1 Project. These ensure each module stays aligned with its purpose and hierarchy. Commands should be issued clearly within a chat to trigger a focused response, reinitialization, or reroute to another module.

---

## 🔁 GLOBAL MAINTENANCE COMMANDS

### `/reset_scope`
> Re-applies the original purpose, rank, and scope of this chat. Use if the conversation has drifted or merged topics.

### `/relink_master`
> Reestablishes connection with 🧠 A1 – Master Vision. This allows the chat to verify it's following the latest hierarchy and workflow definitions.

---

## 🛠️ MODULE-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR

### `/explain_scope`
> Returns a human-readable summary of what this chat is responsible for. Great when you forgot what a chat does or when you're switching contexts.

### `/handoff_to [chat-name]`
> Explains what to send next to another module. If the current task is outside scope, the chat will redirect you with a description and next step.

---

## 🧪 TESTING & SANDBOX

### `/create_test_env_file`
> Prepares a new blank `test-index.html` or `test-main.js` in `/test-env/`. Use for safe prototyping.

### `/summon_sandbox`
> Triggers a conversation with 🔬 D1 – Debug & Feature Sandbox if you're testing new designs, broken features, or wild UI ideas.

---

## 🧾 FILE & DATA REQUESTS

### `/load_data_file [filename]`
> Loads the requested data file (e.g., `uid_enhanced_recipe_registry.json`) into memory for analysis.

### `/where_is [file or feature]`
> Tells you where in the folder structure a file lives or which chat is responsible for it.

---

## 🔗 SYNC & UPSTREAM REPORTING

### `/report_status`
> Generates a quick report to 🧠 A1 with what’s done, in progress, and blocked in this chat.

### `/need_input_from [chat-name]`
> Flags that this chat requires a specific output from another chat. Keeps everyone working in order.

---

## ✅ PRODUCTION CLEANUP

### `/ready_for_merge`
> Confirms a feature/test is stable and ready to merge into `index.html` or `main.js`.

---

## ⚠️ RULES

- Only use commands that start with `/`
- Each module must refuse to perform actions outside their scope and instead guide or redirect
- Master Vision retains override powers on any chat or module

---

Together we are perfect.## 🧠 NEW COMMANDS AND UPDATES

### 🔗 Batch Execution Support
Chats can receive **multiple commands in one message**, and they will process them **in the order they are written**. Separate each command on a new line.

Example:
```
/reset_scope
/get_updates
/log_task Fix broken filter buttons
```

---

## 🧠 Additional Recommended Commands

### `/push_prompt`
> Use after assigning or updating a chat's job. Injects the next required scoped message from 🧠 A1 or from the calling module.

### `/assign [chat-name]`
> Marks the target chat as responsible for the next task. Combines well with `/push_prompt` to delegate.

### `/get_task_log`
> Retrieves a chat's complete logged task history (useful for audits and status reporting).

### `/auto_redirect`
> Enables a chat to **automatically redirect** you to the correct module when you ask for something outside its scope.

### `/watch [file or module]`
> Marks a file or chat for **active sync watching** by a specific module. That module will poll or react to changes in it.
---

## 📂 New Rule: File Output Declaration

Every time a chat generates or modifies a file, it must provide the following table to clearly state:

| Purpose | Filename | Save To | Replaces | Backup Location |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| What does it do? | file_name.json | /data/, /docs/, /assets/, etc. | Which file it updates (if any) | Path to backup original (/data/Legacy/, etc.) |

**Example:**

| Purpose | Filename | Save To | Replaces | Backup Location |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Final production recipe dataset | uid_enhanced_recipe_registry_smart_tags.json | /data/ | Replaces schedule1_all_recipes_named.json | /data/Legacy/ |

All output files MUST be traceable. Do not overwrite without declaring your action. This is a global rule across all modules.

---

## S2 – Codex Prompt Engineer Commands

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/assign S2` | Assigns a prompt engineering task to the Codex module |
| `/push_prompt` | Sends the prompt to be finalized for Codex |
| `/codex_wrap` | Forces strict Codex wrapping (adds file context, task goal, test expectations) |
| `/review_codex_prompt` | Validates whether a task is safe, scoped, and executable by Codex |

## 📄 Migration_Framework_Brainstorm.md

# 🧠 Schedule 1 – Migration Framework Brainstorm

This document outlines the planned transformation of the Schedule 1 Recipe Viewer from a static HTML + JSON system into a full-stack, modern web application using Node.js, Next.js, MongoDB, and CDN-based ISR/SSG. Each section compares the old system to the new approach, explains implementation logic, and flags potential complexities.

---

## 1. 🗂️ Data Storage & Structure

### 🔁 Old:
- JSON files in `/data/`
  - `uid_enhanced_recipe_registry.json`
  - `effect_colors.json`
  - `ingredient_and_strain_icons.json`
- Read directly by `main.js`

### 🔄 New:
- MongoDB collections (NoSQL, schema-flexible):
  - `recipes`
  - `effects`
  - `ingredients`
- Linked via ObjectID or key reference (e.g., recipe references ingredient `_id`s)
- Optional: Use static JSON fallback for local dev

### 💡 Notes:
- Recipes will be migrated as documents with nested fields
- Effects and ingredients become independent collections with their own metadata and indexing

---

## 2. 📄 Rendering Logic

### 🔁 Old:
- Static HTML (`index.html`)
- `main.js` dynamically injects DOM based on loaded JSON

### 🔄 New:
- Next.js file-based routing system
  - `/pages/index.js` → homepage
  - `/pages/strain/[strain].js` → dynamic strain recipe pages
  - `/pages/top-regional.js` → Top Recipes view
- `getStaticProps()` + `getStaticPaths()` for SSG
- `revalidate: N` for ISR (e.g., every 60 seconds)

### 💡 Notes:
- Dynamic strain pages auto-generated at build or revalidated at runtime
- Top regional picks benefit from ISR for freshness

---

## 3. 🎛️ Filtering & Search System

### 🔁 Old:
- Pure JS filtering after loading entire JSON into browser

### 🔄 New:
- Server-side filtering via query params + API routes
- Lightweight frontend fallback filtering if offline
- Debounced input search, tag selection, checkbox filtering

### 💡 Notes:
- Effects and ingredients may be pre-loaded into a global search index
- Filter settings can optionally be shareable via URL

---

## 4. 🧬 Metadata & Tooltips

### 🔁 Old:
- Markdown (`Complete_Effect_Guide.md`) and `effect_colors.json`
- Tooltips added via JS on hover

### 🔄 New:
- Tooltips rendered via React components
- Data pulled via `getStaticProps` or hydrated client-side
- Effects have color + description + region demand baked in

### 💡 Notes:
- Use hover cards or modal popouts for richer UX
- Metadata sources can still include `.md` for developer-facing docs

---

## 5. 🎨 Assets & Icons

### 🔁 Old:
- `/assets/images/` with manual `.webp` matching
- Mapped by `ingredient_and_strain_icons.json`

### 🔄 New:
- Use Next.js `<Image>` component for CDN-optimized loading
- Filename convention (`Banana.webp`, `OGKush.webp`) matched automatically
- Optional: keep icon map JSON for legacy compatibility

### 💡 Notes:
- Can add fallback alt-text if images missing
- Consider generating alt text programmatically

---

## 6. 💾 Favorites / Bookmarking System

### 🔁 Old:
- Not implemented

### 🔄 New:
- LocalStorage to track:
  - Favorited recipes
  - Recently viewed
  - Saved filters
- Optional MongoDB sync if users are ever introduced

### 💡 Notes:
- Can display favorites in header tab or sidebar
- Use shadcn/ui toggles to mark/unmark

---

## 7. 🧪 Testing & Dev Environment

### 🔁 Old:
- `/test-env/` folder with HTML + test JS

### 🔄 New:
- Use `/pages/test-preview.js` in Next.js
- Deploy test branches to staging on Vercel
- Experimental files remain in `test-env/` folder for raw exploration

### 💡 Notes:
- Rebuild `test-index.html` as an interactive dev playground in React

---

## 8. 🚀 Deployment Pipeline

### 🔁 Old:
- GitHub Pages deployment via static build

### 🔄 New:
- Hosted on Vercel with:
  - CDN caching
  - ISR for freshness without rebuilds
  - `vercel.json` config for edge behavior

### 💡 Notes:
- Use environment variables for MongoDB keys, feature toggles
- Rollbacks and preview deploys supported natively

---

## 9. 🧠 Codex & Automation

### 🔁 Old:
- Manual prompt wrapping by A1

### 🔄 New:
- Optional Codex endpoint
- Wrapped JSON patching prompts
- Can simulate fusion, patch recipe files, or validate formats

### 💡 Notes:
- No direct writes unless confirmed by Master Vision
- Add `/docs/Codex_Prompt_Log.md` to track prompt output history

---

## ✅ Final Notes
- All modules (B1–E4) will need to update their behaviors to match this framework
- Test output must now assume API/data interaction, not flat JSON only
- Documentation should reflect modular Next.js structure
- Migration will proceed incrementally, preserving legacy JSON while introducing MongoDB/ISR in parallel
